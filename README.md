This repository contains model code from our Spatial Transcriptomics project, published at ICIBM 2023. I designed and implemented deep learning architectures (transformers, CNNs, and attention-based models) to predict localized gene expression from high-resolution histology images. 
The pipeline involved:
- High-dimensional image processing and feature extraction
- Model development with transformers, CNNs, and attention mechanisms
- Interpretability via weight extraction and biological knowledge mapping
- Survival analysis and prediction integrating spatial transcriptomic features
